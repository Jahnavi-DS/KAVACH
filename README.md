# KAVACH
KAVACH is an AI-based cyber–physical security dashboard that brings together CCTV camera monitoring and cyber log analysis in one place.
It helps security teams quickly understand whether a situation is SAFE, SUSPICIOUS, or THREAT and take early action.
One system. One screen. Complete security awareness.
📌 Why KAVACH?
Current security systems work separately:
CCTV teams watch cameras
Cyber teams monitor system logs
Because these work in silos, combined threats are detected late.
KAVACH solves this by correlating physical activity and cyber activity and showing a single, clear risk level

✨ What This Project Does:
🎥 Monitors live camera feed (webcam / phone camera in demo)
🛡️ Analyzes cyber activity (login attempts, operations – mock data)
🧠 Uses ML models to detect unusual patterns

🤖 AI engine combines both results to decide:
SAFE / SUSPICIOUS / THREAT
📊 Shows everything on one unified dashboard
🧾 Generates a forensic-style report (PDF-ready in concept)
🚨 Prepares alert messages for quick response (demo templates)

🏗️ How It Works (Simple Flow)
Input: Camera feed + cyber logs
ML Analysis: Detect unusual behavior in both
AI Correlation: Combine results into one risk score
Output: Dashboard shows status + reason
Action: Operator reviews and takes action

🧪 Tech Stack
Frontend: React + TypeScript
UI/UX: Glass-morphism style, responsive layout
State Management: Centralized app state for scenarios (Safe/Suspicious/Threat)
AI/ML (Prototype): Computer vision + anomaly detection (conceptual)
Recording: WebM video capture for demo playback

Use Cases:

🏙️ Police command centers monitoring public CCTV
🛡️ Defence labs, data centers, airports
🎓 Hackathon and academic demos for AI-assisted security systems

⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a prototype built for hackathon/academic demonstration.
It shows the concept of integrating cyber and physical security.
Real-world deployment requires secure infrastructure, real CCTV feeds, and trained AI models.

🧠 Key Takeaway

KAVACH helps security teams move from reactive monitoring to proactive threat detection by combining cyber and physical signals into one intelligent view.
